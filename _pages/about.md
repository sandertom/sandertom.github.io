## üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Short Bio

I am a PhD student at FAIR Paris (Fundamental AI Research lab at Meta) and √âcole polytechnique, advised by [Chuan Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0gp5M-kAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Alain Durmus](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=nqLKv6EAAAAJ&hl=fr), and previously by [Alexandre Sablayrolles](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&user=Wy8wM-cAAAAJ) and [Pierre Stock](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&user=3e2-59cAAAAJ).

My research focuses on privacy preserving machine learning and data protection, from Differential Privacy to Watermarking.

Prior to my PhD I studied at [√âcole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), majoring in computer science and mathematics.
 I also hold a Master's degree from [√âcole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) where I studied Mathematics for vision and learning (MVA). 
 I previously interned at Polytechnique Montreal [Universit√© de Montreal](https://corail-research.github.io/), on Reinforcement Learning for Constraint Programing, and at [BNP-Paribas](https://mabanque.bnpparibas/) where I developed tools for fraud detection.
I also spent 6 months as a civil servant in Hano√Ø (Vietnam) as an advisor to the director of [USTH](https://usth.edu.vn/en/), a scientific university.
